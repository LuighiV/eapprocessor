# Processor for Extracellular action potential recordings

This repository has the aim to process the recordings obtained from simulated
extracellular action potentials and apply to it some preprocessing functions
which may help in the spike sorting tasks.

This processor is essentially based on MEArec which is a project developed to
simulate extracellular and whose description is as follows:

- MEArec, Fast and customizable simulation of extracellular recordings on Multi-Electrode-Arrays (https://github.com/alejoe91/MEArec)
 developed by Buccino, A.P., Einevoll, G.T. MEArec: A Fast and Customizable Testbench Simulator for Ground-truth Extracellular Spiking Activity. Neuroinform (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s12021-020-09467-7

This project was slightly modified in this fork: https://github.com/LuighiV/MEArec which introduces minor changes to some functions to be more accesible from derived projects. Hope it could be considered in the original one ðŸ˜Š.
